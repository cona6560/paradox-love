    <div class="poem">
      <p>I found the girl of my dreams</p>
      <p>In the most unlikely of places,</p>
      <p>What began as a whisper on the wind</p>
      <p>Grew into a storm I could not contain.</p>
      <p>What was lustful became a prayer</p>
      <p>In the stillness of her gaze,</p>
      <p>I, enchanted by the scent of her absence,</p>
      <p>Trapped in her potion,</p>
      <p>She, the balm to a world torn apart by noise.</p>
      <p>How I longed to see her face—</p>
      <p>To hold her hands like fragile promises,</p>
      <p>To breathe in her scent like spring</p>
      <p>And so, we met.</p>

      <p>We crossed the rivers of time,</p>
      <p>Passed through fire and shadow,</p>
      <p>Until Friday dawned, and I ascended the stairs</p>
      <p>With trembling legs and a heart</p>
      <p>Heavy with unnamed fears.</p>
      <p>I saw her before me,</p>
      <p>A figure draped in black,</p>
      <p>My breath caught, my thoughts faltered,</p>
      <p>And in that moment,</p>
      <p>The world collapsed into a single beat—</p>
      <p>A silent quake in the depths of my soul.</p>

      <p>She wore a dress that whispered of loneliness,</p>
      <p>A red mouth that spoke in unsaid words,</p>
      <p>Jewels that weighed heavy on her,</p>
      <p>A broken phone in her hands,</p>
      <p>As if already planning her escape.</p>
      <p>But slowly, like dawn breaking over an unlit horizon,</p>
      <p>She smiled,</p>
      <p>And the distance between us melted</p>
      <p>Into something timeless, something more.</p>
      <p>Minutes turned to hours,</p>
      <p>And we walked under the stars</p>
      <p>With the kind of kiss that sears the heart—</p>
      <p>Leaving behind only ashes and dreams.</p>

      <p>She had me in a trance,</p>
      <p>Her beauty, a question that begged no answer.</p>
      <p>Oh, tell me her flaw,</p>
      <p>For I was lost in awe.</p>

      <p>Her hair, a river I would drown in,</p>
      <p>Her waist, a promise I’d never keep.</p>
      <p>Her wit, sharper than any sword,</p>
      <p>Her laughter, an echo I still hear in my dreams.</p>
      <p>Her figure—</p>
      <p>A sin I could not repent for.</p>
      <p>So tell me her flaw,</p>
      <p>For I was lost in awe.</p>

      <p>I fell into her like night falls on a barren land,</p>
      <p>And soon, I laid bare my soul.</p>
      <p>Each passing day unraveled me,</p>
      <p>A thread in the hands of an unseen fate.</p>
      <p>We were one heart, one pulse,</p>
      <p>But the roads beneath our feet began to diverge,</p>
      <p>And I—</p>
      <p>Ignoring the cracks,</p>
      <p>Dreamt only of making her mine.</p>
      <p>To live out my days in her shadow,</p>
      <p>To see the stars align for us alone.</p>
      <p>I would cast away my bloodline,</p>
      <p>I would sever the earth, the sky—</p>
      <p>Just to be hers,</p>
      <p>If only for a moment.</p>

      <p>But the days turned to dust,</p>
      <p>And all things, even love, must fade.</p>
      <p>The world, with its cruel hands,</p>
      <p>Tore at the seams of what we built.</p>
      <p>The breakups, relentless,</p>
      <p>The silences, unbearable—</p>
      <p>Yet we clung to the hope</p>
      <p>That love could defy the reason of the universe.</p>
      <p>But she—</p>
      <p>With eyes that had warned me from the start,</p>
      <p>Wielded her sword,</p>
      <p>And with one final strike,</p>
      <p>Severed our ties.</p>
      <p>The memory of our passion</p>
      <p>Shattered like glass on a cold floor.</p>

      <p>I left soon after for distant shores,</p>
      <p>To chase another life across the ocean’s edge.</p>
      <p>But how can distance mend a soul?</p>

      <p>How can new horizons erase what is etched in the heart?</p>
      <p>I buried myself in the numbness of the city,</p>
      <p>Tried to forget her face,</p>
      <p>But her absence echoed in the alleys of my mind.</p>
      <p>I filled the void with fleeting comforts,</p>
      <p>Drowned myself in shadows of the night,</p>
      <p>But no amount of escape could untangle</p>
      <p>The knot of regret that held me tight.</p>

      <p>Each passing day, a wound that never heals,</p>
      <p>Each moment, a reminder of the love I lost.</p>

      <p>I can’t bear it anymore,</p>
      <p>The weight of her absence,</p>
      <p>The silence where her voice once lingered.</p>

      <p>I can’t stand it anymore,</p>
      <p>This life that spins without meaning.</p>
      <p>The only remedy I know—</p>
      <p>To see her face again,</p>
      <p>To feel her presence beside me,</p>
      <p>If only for a fleeting second.</p>

      <p>But she is gone, and I remain,</p>
      <p>A wanderer lost in my own grief.</p>

      <p>She was my forbidden lover,</p>
      <p>The one who held my soul in her hands.</p>

      <p>How can I live without her?</p>

      <p>She was my sunrise, my moonlit night—</p>
      <p>And now I walk alone,</p>
      <p>Carrying her absence like a scar</p>
      <p>Across the heart of my days.</p>
